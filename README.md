# My first Makeover Monday: Amazon's Profit & Sales Gap
### [Github Pages Site With the Visualization](https://aribcarter.github.io/MakeoverMondayWeek25_Amazon/)

## Inspirations
I was interested in the ideas in the original [Vox article](https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/8/21/20826405/amazons-profits-revenue-free-cash-flow-explained-charts) of how Amazon invests their revenue right back into their company and that helps protect them from paying taxes on the leftover profits. I also found it interesting how some investors would lose interest as soon as Amazon started producing more profits, so I included a chart that addresses that. I sampled the colors from various Amazon logos. 

## Challenges
Styling D3 is still tough for me. I am not a huge fan about the stack of charts on top of each other, and want to work more on transitioning between different charts with animations. However, I wanted to get my ideas out in this visualization without overcomplicating. I'm also not familiar with the different font styles and options in HTML & CSS yet, so the text is pretty plain.
